# Test Telos for Scoring Engine

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-19

## Goals
- G1: Generate $2500/month revenue (Deadline: 2025-03-31)

## Strategies
- S1: The "One Stack, One Month" Rule

**The Rule:** Focus on one technology stack for one full month before switching

**Implementation:**
- November 2025: Python + LangChain + OpenAI
- December 2025: Next stack evaluation

**Why this works:** Prevents context switching and builds deep expertise

## Stack
- Primary: Python, LangChain, OpenAI
- Secondary: Streamlit, FastAPI

## Failure Patterns
- Context switching: Starting new projects before finishing current ones
- Perfectionism: Over-engineering before validating market fit
