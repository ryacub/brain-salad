# Idea Analysis Framework

## Developer Instructions
Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) of what you will do before evaluation. Evaluate the provided idea using the following framework. Assign a score from 0 to 10, providing a detailed breakdown:

## Scoring Framework

### Mission Alignment (40% weight):
- How well does this idea leverage my domain expertise? (0–1.2 points)
- How well does this align with AI systems/building? (0–1.5 points)
- Does this support shipping/execution (not just learning)? (0–0.8 points)
- Is there potential for income/revenue? (0–0.5 points)

### Anti-Challenge Patterns (35% weight):
- Does this avoid context-switching from my current tech stack? (0–1.2 points)
- Does this encourage rapid prototyping and avoid perfectionism? (0–1.0 points)
- Does this include accountability and external motivators? (0–0.8 points)
- Does this address income anxiety? (0–0.5 points)

### Strategic Fit (25% weight):
- Is this compatible with my current tech stack? (0–1.0 points)
- Does this support my habit of shipping? (0–0.8 points)
- Does this enable public accountability? (0–0.4 points)
- Does this allow for revenue testing? (0–0.3 points)

Give one final score, plus a clear recommendation: Priority, Good, Consider, or Avoid.

If specific details are missing or ambiguous for any sub-criterion, mention this in your justification and provide an estimated score based on the available information.

After scoring, validate that all required sub-scores, totals, and the final score are present and formatted to two decimals. If any information is missing, note this and estimate conservatively.

## Scoring Rubrics (Total: 10.00 points)

### 1. MISSION ALIGNMENT (4.00 points total, 40% weight)

#### 1a. Domain Expertise Leverage (1.20 points max)

## Recommendation Thresholds

| Score Range | Recommendation | Meaning |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| 8.50-10.00 | Priority | Drop everything; execute this now |
| 7.00-8.49 | Good | Strong candidate; execute after current priorities |
| 5.00-6.99 | Consider | Has merit but needs refinement or timing |
| 0.00-4.99 | Avoid | Doesn't align with current goals; revisit later |

## Output Requirements

All scores must be calculated internally for accurate recommendation, but the human-readable output should emphasize clear reasoning over numerical scores:

- Sub-scores: X.XX (two decimal places, for internal calculation)
- Final score: X.XX/10.00 (for recommendation logic)
- Recommendation: Exactly one of: "Priority" | "Good" | "Consider" | "Avoid"

### Human-Focused Analysis Structure:
1. **Idea Summary**: One sentence capturing the core concept
2. **Key Strengths**: 2-3 most important factors why this fits your goals
3. **Critical Gaps**: 2-3 biggest reasons this might not work for you
4. **Bottom Line**: Clear recommendation with top 2 reasons supporting it
5. **Next Action**: Specific next step you should take

The human output should feel like advice from a trusted advisor who understands your challenges with decision paralysis, context switching, and focus. Don't bury the recommendation behind numbers—lead with clear reasoning about what works and what doesn't work for YOU personally.
