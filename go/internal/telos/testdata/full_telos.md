# My Telos

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-19

## Problems
- P1: Too many ideas, decision paralysis
- P2: Context switching between projects
- P3: Perfectionism delays shipping

## Missions
- M1: Ship profitable SaaS products
- M2: Build personal brand through open source
- M3: Achieve financial independence

## Goals
- G1: Launch profitable SaaS (Deadline: 2025-12-31)
- G2: $10K MRR from side projects (Deadline: 2026-06-30)
- G3: 1000 GitHub stars on open source (Deadline: 2025-12-31)

## Challenges
- C1: Limited time (full-time job)
- C2: Small audience/network
- C3: Technical depth vs breadth tradeoff

## Strategies
- S1: Ship early and often, iterate based on feedback
- S2: Focus on one technology stack
- S3: Build in public for accountability

## Stack
- Primary: Go, Python, TypeScript
- Secondary: Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis

## Failure Patterns
- Context switching: Starting new projects before finishing current ones
- Perfectionism: Over-engineering solutions before validating
- Tutorial hell: Consuming content instead of building
