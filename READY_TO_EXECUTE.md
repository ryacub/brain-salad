## Three Execution Options Available

### Option 1: Subagent-Driven (RECOMMENDED)
- I dispatch fresh subagent for each task (1-2 hours of work)
- Code review between tasks
- Clear communication on blockers
- Best for: Guidance, review, catching issues early
- Timeline: Can spread across days/weeks
- Next: Just tell me to start Phase 1!

### Option 2: You Execute Yourself
- Follow PHASE_1_DETAILED.md task-by-task
- Commit code as you go
- Reference documents for clarification
- Best for: Learn the approach, full control
- Timeline: 1-2 focused days

### Option 3: Hybrid
- We do Phase 1 together (config abstraction)
- You continue with remaining phases
- I'm available for questions
- Best for: Learn critical path, then self-sufficient
- Timeline: Flexible

## Success Looks Like

After 16-20 hours of work:

```bash
# Friend does this:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/telos-idea-matrix
cd telos-idea-matrix

# Create their own telos.md with THEIR goals
# (Copy from examples or write their own)

# Run it:
tm dump "My startup idea"

# Get back:
# Score: 7.5/10
# Alignment: ✓ Matches G1 (ship product)
# Risks: ⚠ Might trigger perfectionism trap
# Storage: ✓ Saved to local database

# No code changes needed. Just works.
```

   - No hidden dependencies
   - Built-in quality gates

3. **Risk Mitigated**
   - All blockers documented
   - Exit strategies planned
   - Fallbacks specified
   - Testing validates everything

4. **Flexible Execution**
   - Three execution models

## Central Coordination Document

**Use `EXECUTION_TRACKER.md` as your single source of truth:**
- Current progress on each task
- Task status (pending, in-progress, complete)
- Blockers and resolutions
- Git commits created
- Phase completion checklist

Update this file as work progresses. It's your project's brain.

## How to Get Started

### If You Want Subagent-Driven Execution

Just tell me:
> "Let's start Phase 1. Use subagent-driven approach - execute Task 1.1 (Create Configuration Module)."

I will:
1. Dispatch a subagent with Task 1.1 details
2. Subagent completes the work
3. I review the code and results
4. Report completion and next steps
5. Continue with Task 1.2

### If You Want to DIY

1. Read `PHASE_1_DETAILED.md` § Task 1.1
2. Follow the exact specifications
3. Create the code and tests
4. Commit when done
5. Move to Task 1.2

### If You Want Hybrid

1. We start with subagent for Phase 1
2. After Phase 1 completes, you take over
3. I'm available for questions on later phases

## Quality Guarantees

**This plan ensures:**

✅ **Compilation**: Code will compile (`cargo build` passes)
✅ **Testing**: Tests will pass (`cargo test` passes)
✅ **Quality**: No clippy warnings or format issues
✅ **Functionality**: System actually works end-to-end
✅ **Compatibility**: Backward compatible with your current setup
✅ **Extensibility**: Others can add features easily
✅ **Documentation**: Users understand how to use it
✅ **Release**: v0.1.0 is production-ready

- Result: v0.1.0 released same day

### Normal Track (2-3 Days)
- 6-8 hours per day
- Phase per day
- Good for learning
- Result: v0.1.0 released end of week

### Distributed (1-2 Weeks)
- 2-4 hours per day
- Multiple subagents in parallel
- Phase per 2-3 days
- Result: v0.1.0 released mid-month

### Flexible (Self-Paced)
- Work at your own pace
- Pause between phases
- Take time to learn
- Result: v0.1.0 released whenever ready

2. Update EXECUTION_TRACKER.md as you go
3. Report blockers immediately
4. Verify quality gates pass

### After Phase 1
- System works with any telos.md file
- Can pause here and integrate internally
- Or continue to Phase 2

### After Phase 6
- v0.1.0 released
- Friends can use immediately
- No setup friction
- Can be contributed to

## Questions Answered

**Q: Will my current setup break?**
A: No. We add backward compatibility: set TELOS_FILE env var once, then everything works as before.

**Q: Can subagents handle this?**
A: Yes. Every task is specified in excruciating detail. Subagents follow specifications exactly.

**Q: What if we get stuck?**
A: Each task has blocker escalation path. Document the issue, we fix it.

**Q: Can we do this incrementally?**
A: Yes. Complete one phase at a time. Can stop and ship after Phase 2.

**Q: How long does this really take?**
A: 16-20 hours. Can be 1 day intensive or 2 weeks casual.

**Q: Is the code production-ready?**
A: Yes. Tests, CI/CD, documentation, Docker all included.
