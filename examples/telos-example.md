## Goals
- G1: Build AI-powered developer tools that ship fast (Deadline: 2025-12-31)
- G2: Launch profitable SaaS product (Deadline: 2025-06-30)
- G3: Build in public and grow audience (Deadline: 2025-09-30)

## Strategies
- S1: Ship MVPs in 2-4 weeks maximum
- S2: Build in public on Twitter/GitHub
- S3: Focus on AI + Developer Tools niche
- S4: Test revenue early and often
- S5: Use Go, Svelte, and TypeScript primarily

## Stack
- Primary: Go, Svelte, TypeScript, Python
- Secondary: React, Rust, PostgreSQL

## Failure Patterns
- Context Switching: Jumping between too many technologies or projects before shipping
- Perfectionism: Over-engineering solutions before validating with users
- Analysis Paralysis: Researching and planning instead of building and shipping
- Solo Island: Building alone without accountability or public commitment
