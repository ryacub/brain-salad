# Sarah's 2025 Telos - Technical SaaS Founder

## About Me
I'm Sarah, a technical founder building a B2B SaaS platform for team collaboration. I've been coding for 8 years, spent 5 years at a Series B startup as a senior engineer, and took the leap into entrepreneurship in late 2024. I'm solo right now but planning to build a small engineering team once I raise my seed round.

My product helps remote teams run better async standups and retrospectives. I'm at the pre-launch phase with a working prototype and 15 beta users giving feedback.

## 2025 Goals
- G1: Launch MVP to production by Q2 2025 (Deadline: 2025-06-30)
- G2: Acquire 100 paying customers by Q4 2025 (Deadline: 2025-12-31)
- G3: Raise seed round of $500K by Q3 2025 (Deadline: 2025-09-30)
- G4: Build core engineering team of 2-3 developers by Q4 2025 (Deadline: 2025-12-31)
- G5: Reach $10K MRR by year end (Deadline: 2025-12-31)
- G6: Establish thought leadership in async work space (Deadline: 2025-12-31)

## Core Strategies
- S1: Ship fast, iterate based on user feedback - bias toward action over analysis
- S2: Focus on one ICP (remote engineering teams 10-50 people) - no feature sprawl
- S3: Build in public on Twitter and LinkedIn - share metrics, learnings, failures
- S4: Customer development first - talk to 5 users per week minimum
- S5: Weekly shipping cadence - deploy meaningful updates every Friday
- S6: Leverage no-code tools for non-core features to move faster
- S7: Content-led growth - write deeply technical posts that demonstrate expertise
- S8: One stack rule - TypeScript everywhere, no tech experiments during MVP phase

## Tech Stack

### Primary Stack (MVP)

## Failure Patterns

### FP1: Perfectionism Paralysis
I have a tendency to wait for features to be "perfect" before shipping. This burned me in my last side project where I spent 6 months polishing instead of getting user feedback. I need to embrace the "embarrassing first version" philosophy and ship with 70% confidence.

**Triggers**:
- UI doesn't look polished enough
- Code isn't DRY enough
- Error handling isn't comprehensive
- Performance could be better
- Documentation isn't complete

**Antidotes**:
- Set hard shipping deadlines and stick to them
- Define "good enough" criteria before starting features
- Use feature flags to ship partially complete work
- Remember: users care about value, not code elegance
- Ship on Fridays, iterate on feedback the following week

### FP2: Feature Creep
When talking to users, I get excited about every piece of feedback and want to add everything immediately. This leads to scope creep, delayed launches, and a bloated product that loses focus.

**Triggers**:
- Competitor launches new feature
- User requests something "simple"
- Industry trends/hype cycles
- Fear of missing out on opportunities

**Antidotes**:
- Maintain a strict "not now" list
- Every feature request goes through ICE scoring (Impact, Confidence, Ease)
- Ask: "Does this serve my core ICP?"
- Monthly roadmap reviews to prune scope
- Remember my positioning: async standups + retros, nothing else for now

### FP3: Shiny Object Syndrome
I get distracted by new technologies, frameworks, and product ideas. I've started 12 side projects in the last 3 years and finished 1. This time has to be different.

**Triggers**:
- Reading Hacker News
- Seeing other founders' launches
- New AI tools/capabilities
- "Revolutionary" framework releases
- Slow progress on current work

**Antidotes**:
- Block HN and ProductHunt during work hours
- No new tech until current product is profitable
- Keep "ideas backlog" for after exit/success
- Weekly wins document to see progress clearly
- Accountability partner check-ins

### FP4: Solo Founder Burnout
Working alone is draining. No one to brainstorm with, split work with, or keep accountable. I tend to work 70-hour weeks, burn out, then lose a week to recovery.

**Triggers**:
- Fundraising pressure
- Customer escalations
- Technical problems I can't solve quickly
- Comparing to founder teams
- Financial runway anxiety

**Antidotes**:
- Strict work hours: 9am-6pm, no weekends
- Join founder community (Y Combinator Startup School, Indie Hackers)
- Weekly co-working sessions with other founders
- Monthly advisor/mentor meetings
- Hire contractor help for one-off projects
- Exercise 4x per week non-negotiable

## Challenges

### C1: Fighting Perfectionism in Production
**Description**: My engineering background makes me want to optimize, refactor, and polish everything. But as a founder, I need to ship imperfect work that solves problems. The tension between craft and speed is real.

**Impact**:
- Delayed launches
- Over-engineered solutions
- Analysis paralysis
- Missing market windows

**Approach**:
- Adopt "90-day quality" mindset - build for 90 days, not 90 years
- Use technical debt tracker to acknowledge shortcuts consciously
- Set quality bars by feature type (user-facing vs internal)
- Ship beta/alpha versions to subset of users
- Timebox refactoring to 20% of sprint time

### C2: Balancing Customer Requests vs Product Vision
**Description**: Early customers have strong opinions and feature requests. Some align with vision, others don't. Saying no is hard when you need every customer.

**Impact**:
- Product becomes horizontal, not vertical
- Trying to be everything to everyone
- Losing competitive differentiation
- Longer sales cycles

**Approach**:
- Document clear product principles
- Create public roadmap showing priorities
- Framework for feature requests (ICE scoring)
- Educate customers on vision during onboarding
- Be willing to lose customers who aren't good fit

### C3: Solo Founder Loneliness & Decision Fatigue
**Description**: Making every decision alone is exhausting. No co-founder to debate with, share load, or complement skills. Imposter syndrome hits hard.

**Impact**:
- Burnout cycles
- Slower decision making
- Lack of diverse perspectives
- Mental health challenges

**Approach**:
- Build strong advisor network (3-4 advisors)
- Join founder peer groups (5-6 founders at similar stage)
- Share struggles publicly to build support network
- Consider bringing on co-founder if right person appears
- Weekly therapy/coaching sessions

### C4: Technical Debt vs Feature Velocity
**Description**: MVP needs to ship fast, but technical debt compounds. Need to balance speed now with maintainability for future team.

**Impact**:
- Brittle codebase
- Slower feature development over time
- Difficulty onboarding new engineers
- Production incidents

**Approach**:
- Document architectural decisions (ADRs)
- Refactor one major area per month
- Write tests for core business logic
- Use TypeScript strictly to catch errors early
- Plan "quality sprints" every quarter

### C5: Runway Anxiety & Fundraising Pressure
**Description**: 9 months of runway (personal savings). Clock is ticking. Fundraising is a full-time job that distracts from building.

**Impact**:
- Stress affecting health and decisions
- Temptation to cut corners
- Risk-averse behavior
- Distraction from product work

**Approach**:
- Create fundraising timeline with milestones
- Dedicate specific days to fundraising only
- Build runway buffer with consulting/contract work if needed
- Consider alternative paths (bootstrapping, smaller raise)
- Track burn rate weekly

### C6: Pricing & Positioning Uncertainty
**Description**: First-time founder, unclear on pricing strategy. Too low leaves money on table, too high limits adoption. Need to find sweet spot.

**Impact**:
- Underpriced product
- Wrong customer segment
- Unsustainable unit economics
- Competitive disadvantage

**Approach**:
- Study competitor pricing deeply
- Run pricing surveys with beta users
- Implement tiered pricing with clear value props
- Start higher, discount if needed (easier than raising)
- Test pricing with A/B experiments
- Review pricing quarterly based on data

3. **Exercise 4x per week** - Physical health = mental clarity
4. **9am-6pm work hours** - No weekends, sustainable pace
5. **One stack rule** - No tech experiments until profitable
6. **Public accountability** - Share metrics and progress monthly
7. **Community engagement** - Give back, help other founders

## Success Definition

By December 31, 2025, I will consider this year a success if:

1. Product is live with 100+ paying customers
2. Reached $10K+ MRR with healthy unit economics
3. Raised seed funding or have clear path to profitability
4. Built a small team that ships fast and shares the vision
5. Established reputation as credible voice in async work space
6. Maintained physical and mental health throughout
7. Created foundation for sustainable, profitable business

This is just year one. The real goal is building a $10M+ ARR business that genuinely improves how remote teams work. But it starts here, with shipping the MVP and getting those first 100 customers who love the product.

Let's build something people want.
