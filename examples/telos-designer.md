# Jordan's Design Telos - 2025

## About Me
I'm Jordan, a product designer with 3 years of experience working at agencies and startups. I'm passionate about interaction design and building products that feel magical to use. Right now, I'm freelancing while building my portfolio and looking for the right full-time opportunity at a product-led company.

My design philosophy centers on solving real user problems through thoughtful interaction patterns and clean visual systems. I get excited about micro-interactions, design systems, and the intersection of design and code.

## Goals (2025)
- G1: Ship 3 detailed case studies to portfolio (Deadline: 2025-06-30)
- G2: Build following on Dribbble/Behance to 5K+ (Deadline: 2025-09-30)
- G3: Land senior design role at Series B startup (Deadline: 2025-08-31)
- G4: Launch design course or template library (Deadline: 2025-11-30)
- G5: Master Figma automation and plugin development (Deadline: 2025-12-31)

## Strategies
- S1: Daily design challenges (30-day streaks focused on specific skills)
- S2: Rebuild popular products to understand design decisions (Stripe, Linear, Notion)
- S3: Share design process publicly (Twitter threads, YouTube, blog)
- S4: Build reusable design systems for common use cases
- S5: Focus on interaction design as differentiator
- S6: One design tool mastery before adding new tools
- S7: Ship imperfect work to break perfectionism cycle
- S8: Document learnings immediately after projects

## Domain Keywords
UI/UX design, product design, interaction design, design systems, component libraries, user experience, prototyping, micro-interactions, animation, motion design, design tokens, accessibility, responsive design, mobile design, web design, design thinking, user research, wireframing, portfolio development, case studies, design process, visual design, typography, color theory, layout design, grid systems, design patterns, design handoff, design documentation

## Failure Patterns

### Pixel-Perfection Paralysis
I spend hours tweaking padding, colors, and typography instead of shipping. I'll work on a component for days, making microscopic adjustments that no one will notice. This prevents me from completing projects and building a portfolio. I need to embrace "good enough" and iterate based on real feedback.

**Triggers**: Starting new projects, comparing to other designers, before publishing work
**Impact**: Projects never get finished, portfolio stays empty, opportunities missed
**Counter-strategy**: Time-box design phases, use pre-made design systems, ship weekly

### Tool Hopping Syndrome
Every time I see a new design tool or trend, I want to learn it immediately. I've started learning Spline, Rive, Principle, and Origami in the last 6 months but haven't mastered any of them. This dilutes my expertise and prevents deep skill development.

**Triggers**: Twitter/LinkedIn product launches, seeing other designers' work, feeling FOMO
**Impact**: Surface-level knowledge of many tools, master of none
**Counter-strategy**: One new tool per quarter maximum, depth over breadth

### Comparison Paralysis
I constantly compare my work to designers at Google, Apple, or successful indie designers with huge followings. This makes me feel like my work isn't good enough to share, so I don't publish anything. My portfolio has 2 case studies from 2 years ago.

**Triggers**: Browsing Dribbble/Behance, LinkedIn scrolling, award announcements
**Impact**: Imposter syndrome, not sharing work, missing networking opportunities
**Counter-strategy**: Curate social feeds, focus on personal growth metrics, 30-day no-comparison challenge

### Tutorial Collection Without Execution
I have folders full of bookmarked tutorials, courses I've bought, and design resources I've never used. I consume content about design instead of actually designing. I feel productive but have nothing to show for it.

**Triggers**: Newsletter emails, YouTube recommendations, course sales
**Impact**: False sense of progress, no portfolio growth, wasted money
**Counter-strategy**: One tutorial = one project shipped, no new courses until current ones done

## Challenges

### C1: Pixel-Perfect Perfectionism
**Description**: I obsess over tiny details (2px padding differences, exact color values, perfect alignment) to the point where projects never ship. I'll spend 3 hours on a button that could have been done in 20 minutes. This perfectionism is really procrastination and fear of judgment.

**Root Cause**: Fear that work isn't good enough, wanting to impress other designers, lack of confidence

**Strategies to Overcome**:
- Set strict time limits for each design phase
- Use design system components instead of custom designs
- Get feedback at 70% complete rather than 95%
- Remember users won't notice the details I obsess over
- Ship weekly to build comfort with imperfection

### C2: Too Many Tools, Not Enough Mastery
**Description**: I get excited about every new design tool and trend. I've dabbled in Spline, Rive, Principle, Origami, WebFlow, and more, but I'm not truly expert in any of them. This breadth without depth makes me less competitive than designers who've mastered their core tools.

**Root Cause**: FOMO, grass-is-greener thinking, excitement for new technology

**Strategies to Overcome**:
- Commit to Figma + Framer mastery for 2025
- One new experimental tool per quarter maximum
- Delete bookmarks to new tools without trying them
- Measure depth of knowledge, not breadth
- Remember: mastery comes from constraint

### C3: Comparison and Imposter Syndrome
**Description**: I constantly compare myself to designers at FAANG companies or successful indie designers with huge followings. This makes me feel like my work isn't good enough to share publicly. I have unpublished projects sitting in Figma because they "aren't as good as" someone else's work.

**Root Cause**: Social media exposure to top 1% of designers, lack of self-confidence, unclear personal standards

**Strategies to Overcome**:
- Curate social media to reduce comparison triggers
- Focus on personal growth metrics (am I better than last month?)
- Remember everyone starts somewhere
- Share work in progress, not just final results
- Engage with beginner designers to remember my own progress

### C4: Tutorial Consumption Without Creation
**Description**: I have a Notion database with 200+ saved tutorials, 15 half-finished courses, and folders of design resources I've never used. I watch tutorial after tutorial, feeling productive, but I'm not actually building my skills or portfolio. It's passive learning disguised as work.

**Root Cause**: Easier to consume than create, fear of starting real projects, dopamine from "learning"

**Strategies to Overcome**:
- Rule: Watch tutorial = Build project with that technique
- No new courses until current ones are 100% complete
- Unsubscribe from most design newsletters
- Block time for creation, not consumption
- Delete unused bookmarks and resources

### C5: Lack of Strategic Thinking
**Description**: I jump into Figma and start designing without understanding the problem deeply. My portfolio shows pretty interfaces but doesn't demonstrate business thinking, user research, or strategic design decisions. This makes me look junior despite my experience.

**Root Cause**: Design education focused on aesthetics, not strategy; easier to make things pretty than solve hard problems

**Strategies to Overcome**:
- Start every project with problem definition and research
- Include strategy and thinking in case studies
- Read business and product strategy books
- Practice explaining design decisions in business terms
- Work on real problems, not just redesigns

### C6: Inconsistent Public Sharing
**Description**: I go through cycles of posting daily for a week, then nothing for months. This inconsistency means I never build real momentum or audience. I get discouraged when posts don't perform well and stop sharing.

**Root Cause**: Tying self-worth to engagement metrics, perfectionism about what to share, lack of system

**Strategies to Overcome**:
- Batch create content on Sundays for the week
- Commit to minimum viable sharing (doesn't need to be perfect)
- Share process and learnings, not just final work
- Track consistency metrics, not engagement metrics
- Pre-schedule posts to maintain consistency

## Notes & Reflections

### What Energizes Me
- Designing smooth micro-interactions that make products feel alive
- Building comprehensive design systems that empower teams
- Teaching other designers and seeing their growth
- Solving complex UX problems with elegant solutions
- The intersection of design and code

### What Drains Me
- Endless revision cycles on projects that are "good enough"
- Working on products I don't believe in
- Design by committee with no clear vision
- Generic corporate design without personality
- Meetings that could have been async updates

### Personal Design Principles
1. **Interaction over decoration**: Great design responds to user input
2. **System over one-offs**: Build reusable patterns, not snowflakes
3. **Constraint breeds creativity**: Limitations force better solutions
4. **Ship and iterate**: Perfect is the enemy of done
5. **Users over designers**: Design for the 99%, not other designers

### Why This Matters
I believe great design makes technology accessible and delightful. I want to work on products that improve people's daily lives through thoughtful interaction design and clear interfaces. Building my skills, portfolio, and audience gets me closer to working on products I'm passionate about with teams I respect.

This isn't just about career advancement - it's about becoming the designer I know I can be and contributing meaningfully to the design community.
