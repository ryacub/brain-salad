# Current Development Focus - Telos Idea Matrix

## 🎯 Current Status: Production System in Use
The telos-idea-matrix has evolved from the original 1-week MVP into a comprehensive personal productivity system. All 10 original phases have been completed and the system is in active use.

## 📋 Current Focus Areas (Based on Real Usage)

### ✅ **Phase 10 Features Completed**
All originally planned features have been implemented:
- [x] Idea Linking & Dependency Tracking
- [x] Project Timeline Visualization  
- [x] Idea Branching & Variants
- [x] Bulk Operations
- [x] Enhanced Pattern Detection
- [x] Calendar Integration
- [x] Task Management Integration
- [x] Advanced Scoring Features
- [x] User Experience Enhancements
- [x] Advanced Features & Integrations

### 🔄 **Current Priority: Usage-Driven Iteration**
Rather than following the original roadmap, the system now evolves based on actual usage patterns:

#### **Immediate Attention Needed**
- [ ] Monitor actual usage patterns and identify friction points
- [ ] Track which features are used most/least frequently
- [ ] Monitor scoring accuracy against actual outcomes
- [ ] Refine pattern detection based on real behavior data

#### **Medium-Term Enhancements (Based on Usage)**
- [ ] Optimize most-used command sequences for efficiency
- [ ] Add shortcuts for common workflow combinations
- [ ] Adjust scoring weights based on alignment with results
- [ ] Improve error messages based on actual user confusion points
- [ ] Add custom commands/aliases for personal workflows

#### **Long-Term Evolution (Based on Needs)**
- [ ] Integration with calendar for deadline-aware recommendations
- [ ] Mobile capture capability for idea capture anywhere
- [ ] Trend analysis to identify patterns over time
- [ ] Performance tracking against Telos goals
- [ ] Machine learning for personalized pattern detection

### 🔧 **Technical Maintenance**
- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Performance optimization based on usage patterns
- [ ] Code cleanup based on actual feature usage
- [ ] Documentation updates as the system evolves

## 🎯 Value Tracking Metrics
Since this is a personal tool, I track:
- Frequency of idea capture vs. idea loss
- Alignment between scoring recommendations and actual outcomes
- Reduction in context-switching behavior
- Improvement in shipping consistency
- Time saved in decision-making process

## 📊 Current Usage Notes
The system is actively used daily and has significantly reduced decision paralysis and context-switching tendencies. The AI integration provides additional insights when available, but the system works robustly without it.
